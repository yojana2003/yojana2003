## 🚀 About Me
I am a passionate MERN Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building modern, responsive, and scalable web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world products using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

I have worked on full-stack projects like FoodRush, a food ordering application, along with multiple React-based projects that focus on clean UI, performance, and user experience. I am comfortable working on both frontend and backend, creating REST APIs, handling authentication, and managing databases.

Currently, I am enhancing my skills in secure authentication, backend optimization, and advanced React concepts, while continuously learning new technologies to stay up to date in the fast-evolving web development world.

I am a quick learner, problem solver, and a team-oriented developer who enjoys building impactful and efficient web solutions.s
